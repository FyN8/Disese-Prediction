# Disese-Prediction
This project predicts diseases from input symptoms using machine learning. It analyzes a symptom-disease dataset, encoding severity via one-hot encoding, and trains an MLPClassifier that reaches 99% accuracy. Users enter symptoms, which are weighted and fed to the model for predictions. Built with scikit-learn, it can be easily saved for future use
